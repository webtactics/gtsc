Donâ€™t forget to get your entries in for the Division 2 championships. 

Good news this year for all the 50m events you do NOT need to have a verified time in swim central. This is a great opportunity for swimmers new to competitions to get a taste of racing.

As this is a Div 2 Event, essentially the people who generally win, can't race, so it's a great opportunity for swimmers to get a medal.
